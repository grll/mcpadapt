# MCPAdapt

Unlock 650+ MCP servers tools in your favorite agentic framework.

Model Context Protocol is an open-source protocol introduced by Anthropic which allows anyone to simply and quickly make tools and resources available as "MCP Servers".

Since it's release more than 650 MCP servers have been created giving access to many data & tools to supported "MCP Client".

This project makes calling any MCP servers tools seemless from any agentic framework. Virtually providing your agentic worfklow access to 650+ MCP servers tools.

Look at [glama.ai](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers) or [smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/) to give you an idea of what your agent could access.

## Installation Instructions

```bash
# with uv
uv add mcpadapt

# or with pip
pip install mcpadapt
```

## Usage

MCPAdapt adapt any MCP servers into tools that you can use right in your agentic workflow:

```python
with MCPAdapt(
    # specify the command to run your favorite MCP server (support also smithery and co.)
    StdioServerParameters(command="uv", args=["run", "src/echo.py"]),

    # specify the adapter you want to use to adapt MCP into your tool in this case smolagents.
    SmolAgentsAdapter(),
) as tools:
    # enjoy your smolagents tools as if you wrote them yourself
    ...
```

MCP Adapt supports Smolagents, [Pydantic.dev, Langchain, Llammaindex and more...]*.

*coming soon.

## Contribute

If your favorite agentic framework is missing no problem add it yourself it's quite easy:

1. create a new module in `src/mcpadapt/{name_of_your_framework}_adapter.py`:

```python
class YourFrameworkAdapter(ToolAdapter):
    def adapt(
        self,
        func: Callable[[dict | None], mcp.types.CallToolResult],
        mcp_tool: mcp.types.Tool,
    ) -> YourFramework.Tool:
        # HERE implement how the adapter should convert a simple function and mcp_tool (JSON Schema)
        # into your framework tool. see smolagents_adapter.py for an example
    
    def async_adapt(
        self,
        afunc: Callable[[dict | None], Coroutine[Any, Any, mcp.types.CallToolResult]],
        mcp_tool: mcp.types.Tool,
    ) -> YourFramework.Tool:
        # if your framework supports async function even better use async_adapt.
```

2. and that's it, test that your adapter is working and send us a PR to share it with the world.
